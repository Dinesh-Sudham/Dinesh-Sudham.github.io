## NIC to RX buffer.
 When a network packet arrives at a NIC, it is first stored in the NIC’s internal buffers. The NIC then uses Direct Memory Access (DMA) to transfer packets to the system’s main memory, specifically into the buffers managed by the driver, updating the receive (RX) buffer’s pointers in the process. The RX buffer is a ring queue, facilitating producer (NIC) and consumer (driver) operation. This action triggers an Interrupt Request (IRQ), invoking the corresponding interrupt handler, often referred to as the TH. The Top Half (TH) acknowledges the interrupt, performs preliminary handling, and then schedules further processing in a deferred manner,
referred to as the Bottom Half (BH).

## Example Code: Scheduling and Handling Softirqs
Interrupt Handler
static irqreturn_t my_netdev_interrupt(int irq, void *dev_id)
{
    struct net_device *netdev = dev_id;
    struct my_netdev_priv *priv = netdev_priv(netdev);

    // Disable further interrupts from the NIC
    disable_device_interrupts(netdev);

    // Schedule the NAPI poll function
    if (likely(napi_schedule_prep(&priv->napi))) {
        __napi_schedule(&priv->napi);
    }

    return IRQ_HANDLED;
}

## NAPI Poll Function
static int my_netdev_poll(struct napi_struct *napi, int budget)
{
    struct my_netdev_priv *priv = container_of(napi, struct my_netdev_priv, napi);
    struct net_device *netdev = priv->netdev;
    int work_done = 0;

    // Process packets up to the budget limit
    while (work_done < budget) {
        struct sk_buff *skb;

        // Fetch a packet from the device
        skb = fetch_packet_from_device(netdev);
        if (!skb)
            break;

        // Process the packet
        netif_receive_skb(skb);
        work_done++;
    }

    // If we processed fewer packets than the budget, we are done
    if (work_done < budget) {
        napi_complete(napi);
        // Re-enable interrupts
        enable_device_interrupts(netdev);
    }

    return work_done;
}
