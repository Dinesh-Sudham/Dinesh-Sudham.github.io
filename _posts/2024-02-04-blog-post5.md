Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) architecture enables efficient data transfer between Compute Nodes (CN) in a High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment. RDMA over Converged Ethernet version 2 (RoCEv2) utilizes a routed IP Fabric as a transport network for RDMA messages. Due to the nature of RDMA packet flow, the transport network must provide lossless, low-latency packet transmission. The RoCEv2 solution uses UDP in the transport layer, which does not handle packet losses caused by network congestion (buffer overflow on switches or on a receiving Compute Node). To avoid buffer overflow issues, Priority Flow Control (PFC) and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) are used as signaling mechanisms to react to buffer threshold violations by requesting a lower packet transfer rate. 


# Host Channel Adapter(HCA)
  A Host Channel Adapter (HCA) is a hardware device that connects a host system to an RDMA-enabled network, such as InfiniBand or RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet).

# libibvers
RDMA Verbs are a set of software interfaces that allow applications to communicate with RDMA devices, enabling RDMA operations such as data transfer, memory registration, and queue management.
